# Brest-cancer-detection-mini-project-
This is an academic mini- project (related to school) made during the sessions of Data Analysis where we use the PCA to detect the best parameters that can indicate if the tumor is benign or malignant 
We have used the "load_brest_cancer" dataset which is a predifined dataset of scikit-learn
